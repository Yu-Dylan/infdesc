\subsection*{Means}

\begin{chapex}
\textit{Unit cost averaging} is an investment strategy in which an investor invests a fixed amount of money in an asset in equal instalments over a fixed period of time.

Let $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ with $a<b$, let $n \ge 1$, and let $f : [a,b] \to [0,\infty)$ be such that at time $t \in [a,b]$, an asset is trading at £$f(t)$ per share. Assume that you invest a total of £$M$ in the asset in equal instalments of £$\dfrac{M}{n}$ at times $t_0, t_1, \dots, t_{n-1}$, where $M \in [0,\infty)$, $n \ge 1$, and $t_i = a + i \cdot \dfrac{b-a}{n}$ for all $0 \le i < n$.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Prove that the value of the shares that you hold at time $b$ is equal to
\[ \text{£}~\dfrac{f(b)}{\mathrm{HM} \big ( f(t_0),~ f(t_1),~ \dots,~ f(t_{n-1}) \big)} \cdot M \]
where $\mathrm{HM}(a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n)$ denotes the harmonic mean of $a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n \in \mathbb{R}$.

\item Under what condition have you made a profit?
\end{enumerate}
\end{chapex}

\subsection*{Sequences}

\begin{chapex}
Does there exist a sequence $(x_n)$ such that $(x_{n+1} - x_n) \to 0$ but $(x_n)$ diverges?
