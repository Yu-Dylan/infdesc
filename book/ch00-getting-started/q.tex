The video-sharing website \textit{YouTube} assigns to each video a unique identifier, which is a string of 11 characters from the set
\[ \{ \mathtt{A}, \mathtt{B}, \dots, \mathtt{Z}, \mathtt{a}, \mathtt{b}, \dots, \mathtt{z}, \mathtt{0}, \mathtt{1}, \mathtt{2}, \mathtt{3}, \mathtt{4}, \mathtt{5}, \mathtt{6}, \mathtt{7}, \mathtt{8}, \mathtt{9}, \text{\texttt{-}}, \text{\texttt{\_}} \} \]
This string is actually a natural number expressed in base-64, where the characters in the above set represent the numbers $0$ through $63$, in the same order---thus $\mathtt{C}$ represents $2$, $\mathtt{c}$ represents $28$, $\mathtt{3}$ represents $55$, and \texttt{\_} represents $63$. According to this schema, find the natural number whose base-64 expansion is $\mathtt{dQw4w9WgXcQ}$, and find the base-64 expansion of the natural number $7\,159\,047\,702\,620\,056\,984$.
