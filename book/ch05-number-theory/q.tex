Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Prove that the number of trailing $0$s in the decimal expansion of $n!$ is equal to
\[ \sum_{k=1}^d \left\lfloor \dfrac{n}{5^k} \right \rfloor \]
where $d \in \mathbb{N}$ is least such that $5^{d+1}>n$, and where $\lfloor x \rfloor$ \inlatex{lfloor,\textbackslash{}rfloor} denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to $x \in \mathbb{R}$ (called the \textbf{floor} of $x$).
\hintlabel{cqTrailingZerosOfFactorialByInduction}{%
Start by proving that, for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and all $k \in \mathbb{N}$, there are exactly $\left\lfloor n/5^k \right\rfloor$ natural numbers $\le n$ that are divisible by $5^k$. Then consider how many zeros are contributed by each factor of $n!$ to the decimal expansion of $n!$.

\begin{chapex}
Let $b \in \mathbb{N}$ with $b \ge 2$. Find an expression in terms of $n \in \mathbb{N}$ for the number of trailing $0$s in the base-$b$ expansion of $n!$.
\hintlabel{cqTrailingZerosOfFactorialByInductionBaseB}{%
This will be similar to \Cref{cqTrailingZerosOfFactorialByInduction} in the end; to get started, consider the greatest prime factor of $b$.
